## What is Orchestry?

Orchestry is a container orchestration platform that provides:

- **Intelligent Auto-Scaling**: Automatically scales your applications based on CPU, memory, RPS, latency, and connection metrics
- **Load Balancing**: Dynamic Nginx configuration with health-aware routing
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic recovery
- **Simple Deployment**: YAML-based application specifications
- **RESTful API**: Complete programmatic control
- **High Availability**: Distributed controller with leader election eliminates single points of failure
- **Database HA**: PostgreSQL-based state management with primary-replica replication

## Key Features

- **Container Orchestration**: Docker-based application lifecycle management
- **Multi-Metric Auto-Scaling**: CPU, memory, RPS, latency, and connection-based scaling
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Nginx with health-aware routing and SSL termination
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks with automatic recovery
- **Distributed Architecture**: 3-node controller cluster with leader election
- **High Availability**: Automatic failover and split-brain prevention
- **CLI and REST API**: Complete programmatic and command-line interfaces
- **Persistent State**: PostgreSQL with primary-replica setup
- **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail and cluster event tracking
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory constraints and intelligent scaling policies
